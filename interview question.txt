kubernate is doing  container management / container orchestration

Q) tell me the size of cluster with which you have worked 

i have worked with 2 master nodes and 5  to 9 worker nodes 

why 2 master nodes:

1 master node failed , i can switch to master 2

when every work load is increase we get more container , we run 10 worker nodes 
 when every work load is less , you run 2 worker nodes 






q) DAEMONSET VS DEPLOYMENT 

purpose of daemonset : 
i want to know what is happong on worker node ,put the daemonset in worker node 
daemonset is special kind of deployment where it make sure atlaset on daemonset in one worker node 

maily use daemonset for monitaring purpose
